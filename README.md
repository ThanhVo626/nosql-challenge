# nosql-challenge
Initially I had problems with importmongo but I managed to fix it by reinstalling all the programs from the getting started. Then I had connecting to server issues because I closed the database but I solved that by opening MongoDBCompass and establishing the connection.

Part 1 was fairly simple after I fixed the mongoimport issue and just copied the code we used in class and replaced the file names.

Part 2 involved taking in a new restaurant and inserting it into our database and made edits.
The hardest part was figuring out the syntax for converting the lat/long/ratingvalue. The main thing I learned from this part was you need to have the 2nd argument in brackets even though it only one dictionary.

Part 3 was slightly harder because we had to incorperated new ways to filter and sort the data.
